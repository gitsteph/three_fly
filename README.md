# three_fly

A simple experiment in photogrammetry, using a common cell phone camera, agisoft software, and three.js.

The 3D model loaded in the scene was created using very few photos!  So it's not very 3D but does have some texture and interesting digital artifacts.  I'll come back to this to include the source photos used to generate my model at some point.

Thank you to [Jimmy](https://github.com/jimmyland) for help with three.js!
